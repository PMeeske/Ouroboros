# AI Ethics Overview

Artificial Intelligence ethics focuses on ensuring AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly. Key concerns include bias in training data, lack of transparency in decision-making (the 'black box' problem), and potential job displacement.

## Core Principles
- Fairness: AI should not discriminate based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics
- Transparency: Users should understand how AI makes decisions
- Accountability: Clear responsibility for AI actions
- Privacy: Protection of personal data used in AI systems
